Fres-co produces and manufactures bags domestically and so the shipping distance and time it takes to get to us is dramatically reduced. We will soon be taking a closer look at our packaging options to align with a more sustainable long-term partner.

            "question": "What is Biotrē packaging?",
            "answer": "<p>Biotrē 1.0 is made from 60% (by weight) renewable wood pulp. The wood pulp portion is biodegradable. Third-party testing per ASTM tests D-6868 and D-6400 confirmed that nearly all of the wood pulp portion will disintegrate into healthy compost over 84 days in a backyard, home composting environment. Internal studies in moist, managed home compost have shown a degradation time of 90 days.<\/p><p><br\/>The remaining 40% (by weight) of the bag is Polyethylene (PE) made from petroleum-based sources.<br\/><\/p><p>Biotrē 1.0 is not compatible with industrial or municipal composting. It is best disposed of by placing it in a privately managed compost pile where the 40% PE layer, the one-way degassing valve, the tin tie, and any stickers can be removed manually and disposed of in the regular trash.<br\/><\/p><p>Although 60% (by weight) of our bags will break down into healthy compost, we cannot label them as compostable because they do not meet the definition of “compostable” under California law. Consumers trying to be conscious should remove the valve, tin tie, stickers, and compost in their backyard. There will be plastic left after 84 days, which should be thrown away.<br\/><\/p><p>We have chosen this packaging because we think it provides environmental benefits without sacrificing our coffee’s freshness and quality. However, we acknowledge that 60% is not 100%, and we will continue to look for packaging that meets our quality standards and can be disposed of in a more environmentally friendly way.
